# Design Patterns Notes - 1

### What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are reusable solutions for common problems found in software design. They are broadly divided into 3 categories -

- Creational Design Patterns
- Structural Design Patterns
- Behavioural Design Patterns

### Creational Design Patterns

- Deal with object creation mechanism.
- Trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation.
- Eg:
  - Singleton
  - Builder
  - Factory
  - Prototype and Registry

### Structural Design Patterns

- Focus on class and object composition.
- They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system does not have to change
- Eg:
  - Adapter
  - Facade
  - Decorator
  - Flyweight

### Behavioural Design Patterns

- Concerned with the way classes or objects communicate.
- Eg:
  - Strategy
  - Command
  - Observer
